cd /path/to/your/project

# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

**Using Node.js (if installed)**:
```bash
# Install a simple server globally
npm install -g live-server

# Navigate to your project folder
cd /path/to/your/project

# Start server
live-server
```

**Using PHP (if installed)**:
```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd /path/to/your/project

php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Important Notes

- **GitHub Pages** is the most reliable free option
- All functionality (geolocation, admin panel, localStorage) works on live sites
- Your website will be accessible to anyone with the URL
- The admin panel will be at `YOUR_URL/admin.html`
- All data is stored in the user's browser, so it's private and secure

## Troubleshooting

### Geolocation Not Working
- Make sure you're using HTTPS (required for geolocation on live sites)
- Check browser permissions for location access
- Test on different browsers

### Images Not Loading
- Ensure all image files are in the `images/` folder
- Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify file paths in the HTML

### Admin Panel Issues
- Clear browser cache and localStorage
- Check if you're logged in (look for logout button)
- Try accessing `admin.html` directly

Your website is now ready to go live! ðŸš€
